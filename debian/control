Description: Flexible I/O Tester
 fio is a tool that will spawn a number of threads or processes doing a
 particular type of io action as specified by the user. fio takes a
 number of global parameters, each inherited by the thread unless
 otherwise parameters given to them overriding that setting is given.
 The typical use of fio is to write a job file matching the io load
 one wants to simulate.
